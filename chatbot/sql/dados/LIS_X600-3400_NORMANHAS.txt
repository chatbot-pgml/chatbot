2. General Description 
Laboratory Information System refers to the inte rface that communicates between the System and 
the Laboratory Computer System (Lab Computer). This communication can occur using either the HL7 or ASTM protocols. 
With the ASTM protocol, communication can occur ov er either a serial line from the System to 
the Lab Computer or through the user’s network. With the HL7 protocol, the communication only 
occurs over the user's network.  The communica tions are bi-directional and include downloading 
sample programs from the Lab Computer to the System, uploading result records from the System to the Lab Computer, querying sample programs from the System to the Lab Computer, querying 
inventory from the Lab Computer to the System, and sending asynchronous notifications from the 
System to the Lab Computer. This document covers  each of these aspects from the perspective of 
the System. 
The specifications in this document are grouped into the following sections:  
 Communications – This includes the phys ical interfaces and specific communications 
processing called for by the HL7 and ASTM protocols. 
 Record Processing - This specif ies the content of the messages (e.g., sample programs, results 
records patient information) and their components to be implemented in this application. The 
format and hierarchy are specified in Section 5.2 ASTM Messages and Section 5.4 HL7 
Messages.

2022-05-25 2.2 Operational Overview 
The following overview shows the general way the interactions occur between the LIS and 
System.  There are other modes including error scenarios that are further detailed in the 
specifications. 
2.2.1 Download Sample Programs 
Sample programs containing specimen ID, patient information, and tests to be run are ente red
in

2.3 Design Constraints 
The System software is compatible with  ASTM specifications LIS1-A and LIS2-A. 
The System software is compatible  with HL7 v2.5 specifications, chapters 2, 3, 4, 7 and 13. This 
HL7 version does not include provisions for Host Query functionality so a custom Z segment is used. 
2.4 Assumptions, Dependencies and Resulting Risks 
 Only one LIS is connected at any one time to an Analyzer. 
 The LIS provider complies with this specification. 
 The specifications in this document apply to all protocols unless otherwise specified. 
 The specifications of message processing are independent from those of communication. For 
example, where a protocol (e.g.,  ASTM) is mentioned in a processing specification, it applies 
to all communication methods supporting that protocol (e.g., Ethernet and Serial). 
 This document will not describe the GUI itself,  but only the functionality of the feature. 
 No hardware requirements will be  detailed in this document. 
 An EIA RS-232 compatible serial communications port with a standard DB25 female 
connector is assumed for communication betw een the System and th e Lab Computer when 
using the serial interface. 
 A TCP/IP compatible network communications port with a standard Ethernet network is 
assumed for communication between the System  and the Lab Computer when using the 
Ethernet interface. 
 The security of network communications is the responsibility of the user. Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Communication Specifications  
Pub. No. J32799 15 
2022-05-25  The system’s firewall needs to be configured to allow communications to/from the LIS when 
using TCP/IP. 
3. Communication Specifications 
The following specifications are for the layers responsible for transporting messages between the 
System and the LIS. The content of these message s is not relevant for th ese layers, which only 
ensure that messages are transferred in  an error-free manner between systems. 
The System acts as a sender  
 When a host query is initiated  
 When results need to be uplo aded to the Lab Computer  
 When sending an asynchronous message 
 When responding to an inventory query  
The System acts as a receiver  
 When the Lab Computer responds to a host query 
 When sample programs are to be downloaded 
 When sending an inventory query   
Upon System startup, the LCI module tests communications. If a connection to a LIS cannot be established, the LCI communicates an error condition to the 
operator. 
3.1 Physical Interfaces  
Note:  See Appendix I Mechanical/Electrical Inte rfaces for details ab out these interfaces. 
3.1.1 Physical Ethernet Interface 
The ASTM and HL7 protocols support the use of TCP/IP communication for the physical 
transport layer. The two protocols share the same specifications for this layer. 
The System establishes a connection to the Lab Co mputer at a configured  IP address and port. 
Note:  This interface is bidirectional but only initiated by the System. 
3.1.2 Physical Serial Interface 
The System 
 Uses 1 start bit   
 Supports 1 or 2 stop bits 
 Supports EVEN, ODD, and NONE parity 
 Uses 8 data bits 
 Supports the following baud rates: 
 9600

Note:  All referenced sections can be found in Standard Specification for Low-Level Protocol to 
Transfer Messages Between Clinical Labora tory Instruments and Computer Systems, 
NCCLS LIS1-A (Formerly ASTM E1381-02). 
The ASTM layers involved in transferring data from the System to the Lab Computer and the Lab 
Computer to the System are divided into these components: 
 Physical Layer - Comprised of the actual hardware and software configuration used to 
communicate between the two sy stems. For serial communications, this corresponds to 
Section 5. For Ethernet communications, this corresponds to Section 7 and 8.2.1.1. For specifications, refer to the appropriate Interface (Ethernet or Serial). 
 Datalink Layer - Responsible for the logical data frames comprised of the raw data exchanged 
with the physical layer. It ensures that packet s can be transferred in an error-free manner 
between machines. For serial communications th is corresponds to the Datalink layer specified 
in Section 6. For Ethernet communications, this corresponds to Section 8.  
The System supports a configurable maximum fr ame size that supersedes values specified in 
Standard Specification fo r Low-Level Protocol to Transfer Me ssages Between Clin ical Laboratory 
Instruments and Computer Systems,  NCCLS LIS1-A (Formerly ASTM E1381-02).

The System supports the Restricted Message Ch aracters requirement specified in Section 8.6. 
3.3 HL7 Communications 
3.3.1 HL7 MLLP Communications 
This layer is responsible for implementing the MLLP protocol. This protocol, defined by 
HL7 2.3.1 standard, is essentially a half-duplex protocol, where a new message is sent only after 
receiving the acknowledgement fo r the previous message. The System implements MLLP as 
described in HL7 2.3 Implementation Guidelines . The System supports Error Recovery as 
specified in Section C.2.6. This includes Connect Retries, Section C.2.6.1; Connect Pause, Section 
C.2.6.3; and Receive Timeout Errors, Section C.2.6.2.  
Every HL7 message is enclosed by special characters to form a block formatted as 
<SB>dddd<EB><CR> , where: 
 <SB> - start block character (1 byte), ASCII VT = 0x0B 
dddd  - Data (variable number of bytes). This is the HL7 data content of the block. The data 
can contain any single-byte values greater than 0x1F and the ASCII carri age return character, 
<CR>. 
<EB> - end block character (1 byte), ASCII FS = 0x1C 
<CR> - carriage return (1 byte) = 0x0D  
Messages received with incorrect delimitation characters are ignored .  
The System 
 Supports a timeout of 30 seconds. This timeout  is used by the connect and receive timeout. 
 Supports a retry count of 5. The value is used by the connect retry. 
 Supports a retry action pause of 0 seconds. 
 Accepts messages up to the configured frame si ze (in bytes). Messages longer than this value 
are treated as a timeout and logged as a bad frame. 
 Goes into a neutral state after attempting to reco nnect to the LIS a config ured number of times 
(5 times), pauses a configured amount of tim e (0 seconds), and then  waits a configured 
timeout for each connection attempt (30 seconds).  
 Requires a manual operation to restart the connection process after reaching the neutral state. 
Note:  The connection process is re-initiated by a reconfiguration, a new upload message, or an 
operator initiated request. Processing Specifications  Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide 
 Pub. No. J32799 
18 2022-05-25  4. Processing Specifications 
The following specifications apply to all protocols. 
The transfer of data between the LIS and the System occurs when: 
 The System is at least at ready state and configured to send and/or receive. 
 The hardware required is connected.  
The software supports the processing of samples while sample programs are downloaded to the 
System. 
In the case of contention between  the System sending or requesting data and the Lab Computer 
sending unsolicited data, the System activity takes priority. 
4.1 HL7 Message Acknowledgements 
For the HL7 protocol, the System expects to recei ve an ACK for each message it sends to the LIS. 
If the System does not receive an  ACK before the send timeout ex pires, then the System assumes 
that the RSP^ZOS message is lost, reestablishe s the connection, and sends the message again. 
The System acknowledges all HL7 messages (ex cept OML) received from a LIS by sending an 
ACK. See Section 5.4.1 HL7 ACK Acknowledgement Message. 
If the protocol is set to HL7, the System produces an ORL - general laboratory order response for 
each OML (event O21) and each RSP^ ZOS instead of an ACK message. 
If the message cannot be acted upon, the Sy stem includes an er ror segment in the 
acknowledgement. 
Messages that are not supported by the System re sult in an ACK message with an error condition 
code 200 – Unsupported message type. 
ACK messages that are not expected  by the System are discarded.  
The System supports 
 A timeout of 30 seconds. This timeout is used by the send. 
 A retry count of 5. The value is used by the send retry. 
 A retry action pause of 0 seconds 
4.2 Downloading Sample Programs 
The following specifications are for the download of sample program messages. See Section 4.3 
LIS Append for a complete set of requirements regarding the subsequent processing that occurs when downloaded sample  program is received. 
The System uses the following format for the Universal Test ID: value=^^^LocalOrMfctrCode 
where LocalOrMfctrCode = ManualDilution + TestCode + TestDilution~TestCode + TestDilution~… where TestCode + TestDilution is  repeated for each assay in the program. 
If the protocol is set to ASTM, the System pro cesses an Order Download message when received 
from a LIS. See Section 5.2.1 Order Downlo ad Message Structure for the structure. 
If the protocol is set to ASTM, the System dis cards any comment records that appear after an 
Order Record on a download. 
If the protocol is set to ASTM, the System accepts only General comments pertaining to patient 
demographics (those that app ear after a Patient Record). 
If the protocol is set to HL7, the System processes an OML message, Laboratory Order Request 
(event O21) when received from a LIS. See S ection 5.4.2 HL7 OML Labo ratory Order Message 
Structure. Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Processing Specifications  
Pub. No. J32799 19 
2022-05-25 Note:  In relationship to triggers O21, O33, and O 35, this message/trigger (O21) is used when 
an order with multiple samples and optionally multiple containers per order item are to be 
communicated. 
If the protocol is set to HL7, the System sends the application acknowledgement (ORL) message 
indicating whether the order is accepted or reject ed by the System. See Section 5.4.3 HL7 ORL 
Laboratory Order Response Message Structure. 
Note:  1) This ORL message indicates that the message was parsable and passed an initial set of 
edits.  The order may still fail Sample Progra mming audits and return another message 
(Download Message) back to the LIS indicating the subsequent failure. 2) Manually (on 
System) entered orders and updates to orders  originally received from the LIS will not 
create an ORL. 3) Other test requests (e.g., derived tests or their test components) may 
appear in the ORL when they were not reques ted by the LIS-OML. These do not need to 
be created by the LCI since they will be automatically generated by the System and 
associated with the order when the order (OML) is processed by the System. 
If the protocol is set to HL7, the System only processes the first SAC segment for an SPM in each 
OML message while ignoring the remainin g SAC segments if they are present. 
If the protocol is set to HL7, the System accepts the first NTE segment that contains a comment 
type of “Generic” while ignoring the remaining NTE segments. 
4.3 Auditing and Storing Sample Programs 
4.3.1 Supported Fields

20 2022-05-25   Collection Time 
 Comments (up to 60 characters) 
 Physician Last Name (up to 20 characters) 
 Physician First Name (up to 15 characters) 
 Physician Middle Initial (1 character)

4.3.1.1 Truncating Long Fields 
After stripping any leading and trailing blanks, if  any of the following fields in a downloaded 
program contains more than their maximum number of characters, the System truncates the fields 
and no download message is generated.  
 The demographic “Physici an Last Name” field 
 The demographic “Physici an First Name” field 
 The demographic “Physician Middle Initial” field 
 The demographic “Patient Address” field 
 The demographic “Patient Room Number” field 
 The demographic “Comments” field 
 The demographic “Physician ID” field 
After stripping any leading and trailing blanks, if  any of the following fields in a downloaded 
program contains more than their maximum number of characters, download message #2 is generated and the program is rejected.  
 The demographic “Patient ID” field 
 The demographic “Patient Last Name” field (part of a key field) 
 The demographic “Patient First Name” field (part of a key field) 
 The demographic “Patient Middle Initial” field (part of a key field) 
 The demographic “Patient Birth Date” field (System date audits apply) 
 The demographic “Collection Date” field (System date audits apply) 
 The demographic “Collection Time” field (System time audits apply) 
 The sample program “Sample ID” field (other audits apply) 
 The sample program “Tray” field (other audits apply) 
 The sample program “Cup” fi eld (other audits apply) 
 The sample program “Dilute” field (other audits apply) 
 The sample program “Manual Dilution” field (other audits apply) 
 The demographic “Sex” field (other audits apply) 
 The demographic “Demographic Attribute” field (other audits apply) 
Note:  For HL7 messages, violation of character count s in the above fields (with the exception 
of the two dilution fields) results in the rejection of the message at transmission time. As 
a result, no download message is generated. The ERR segment of the acknowledgment 
will indicate the error Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Processing Specifications  
Pub. No. J32799 21 
2022-05-25 4.3.2 LIS Sample Program Verification 
Downloaded sample programs that contain erro rs can be dispositioned in a variety of ways. 
Serious errors result in the rejection of the en tire sample program and cause a download message 
to be generated. Less serious errors could cause the rejection of a single assay but would also 
generate a download message. The least serious conditions result in processing the valid portion of 
the sample program while ignoring the invalid po rtion. For example, if a dilution factor is 
specified for a derived test, the test is performed but the dilution factor is not applied. 
Download messages are generated to represent the detection of the following types of sample 
programming and validation errors.  Except when explicitly noted, all the messages indicate the rejection of an entire sample program. (Code numbers are included in parenthesis. Item numbers displayed in brackets do not pertain to this System; they are included in this list for completeness.)  
Note:  See Appendix H Download Messages for a lis t of the messages and the recommended 
action for each message. 
 Missing sample ID (1) – The sample  program has a blank sample ID. 
 Invalid data in field (2) – The sample program has problems with data in one or more 
fields.  That could include invalid characters,  fields that were too long, a body fluid 
mismatch for an append program, or an unsuccessful lookup of sex or range attribute. 
 Tray name or cup missing (4)  
o The tray name was specified but the sample program does not have an assigned 
sample position. 
o The sample program has a sample position but no tray name specified. 
 Sample/patient name mismatch (6) – The samp le program has the same sample ID as a 
program already in the sample DataBase, but the patient names (last, first and MI) do not match. 
 Sample program/cup mismatch (7) – The samp le program has a position that has already 
been assigned to another sample program. 
 Sample manually edited (12) – An attempt was made to edit the sample program from the 
Lab Computer after it had been edited using the Sample Programming screen. 
 No assays requested (13) – The sample progr am was downloaded with no assay requests. 
This applies only if the sample program does not exist to begin with. 
 Invalid assay requested (14) – An assay was requested which is currently not supported 
by the System. The program is accepted but th e unsupported assay is deleted from the 
program. 
 Derived test replicated (15) – The sample program included a request to replicate a 
derived test. The program is accepted and the requested derived test is calculated. 
 Too many assays (16) – The sample program has more than the maximum assays or 
replicates requested. This includes volume checks. 
 Sample/tray program changed (17) – The sample program has been assigned to another 
tray. The sample program is accep ted as long as that tray is not currently in the metering 
area. 
 Sample program taken off tray (18) – The sample program has become unassigned. The 
sample program is accepted.  If the matchi ng sample is in the buffer, automatic 
assignment will assign the unassigned program; therefore, this audit code may only be generated if the matching sample is not in the metering area. Processing Specifications  Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide 
 Pub. No. J32799 
22 2022-05-25   No assays: sample deleted (19) – The sample program did not include any assays and was 
deleted by the Lab Computer. 
 Dilution out of range (20)   
o The manual dilution factor for this sample  program is not between 0.0001 – 9999.0. 
o The product of Test Dilution factor (i.e.,  Operator Requested Dilution) and Standard 
Dilution factor is not a valid dilution factor. 
o The assay is not dilutable and the test dilution factor is not 1.0. 
o The assay is not configured for a diluent fluid and the Test Dilution factor (i.e., 
Operator Requested Dilution) is not 1.0 
 Body fluid unknown (22) – The sample program included a body fluid that the System 
does not currently support. 
 Program pretreated assays separately (23) – The sample program included pretreated and 
non-pretreated assays or incl uded pretreated assays from multiple pretreatment groups. 
This restriction does not apply to QC programs. 
 Assays in progress could not be deleted (25) – An attempt to delete the program was 
made. The sample program is accepted but not all tests could be deleted because they 
were already in process.  These tests will be  completed, but they will be prevented from 
reprocessing. 
 Attempt to edit a program in process (26) – An attempt was made to append to a program 
while it was in process but program information was changed that cannot be changed when the program is in process. The program is rejected. 
 An append program was downloaded but not all the assays could be added to the program 
(27).  For example, a derived test was requested, but one of the components was already in the original program.  The program is saved. 
4.3.3 Storing Sample Programs 
The System allows local sample programming to occur simultaneously with LIS downloaded 
sample programming or host query. 
The System supports the ability  to add a new sample progr am received from the LIS. 
A sample program being downloaded from the LI S overwrites a saved sample program when all 
of the following conditions are met:  
 The Sample ID of a saved sample program matches the ID of the downloaded sample 
program. 
 The patient first name, last name, and middle initial on the saved program are the same as 
on the downloaded program. 
 The saved sample program was previously downloaded from the LIS. 
 The saved sample program has not been modified through the System’s GUI. 
 The saved sample program is not in process. 
Note:  Some sample program verification audits described above may prevent the program from 
being saved. 
The downloaded sample pr ogram causes the deletion of a saved sample program when all of the 
following conditions are met:  
 The Sample ID of a saved sample program matches the ID of downloaded sample 
program. Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Processing Specifications  
Pub. No. J32799 23 
2022-05-25  The patient first name, last name, and middle initial on the saved program are the same as 
on the downloaded program. 
 The downloaded sample progr am is marked for cancellation or there are no tests 
programmed. 
 The saved sample program was previously downloaded from the LIS. 
 The saved sample program has not been modified through the System’s GUI. 
 The sample program is not in process. 
Note:  For sample programs that are in process, as says in the program w ill be prevented from 
any possible reprocessing but not be deleted from the program. 
If a new sample program (not an append) is down loaded from LIS for a samp le that already has a 
program in process, the following shall occur: 
 The program in process is deleted from the database. 
 All tests of the program in process are allowe d to complete, but no reprocessing occurs. 
 The new program is saved to the database. 
Discussion:  Some sample program verification audits described above may prevent the program 
from being saved. 
Discussion: The new program will be started when 1) th e program in process is complete and the 
sample is re-scanned, or 2) when a new program is downloaded, and the program in process is 
complete, and the sample is still in the metering area. 
When processing a downloaded sa mple program, the System applie s an assay's default replicate 
count to the first downloaded test; each additi onal downloaded test sha ll not apply the replicate 
count.  
Note:  For example, if an assay's default replicate co unt was 3, and there were 2 requests for the 
assay in the download, a total of 4 reps would be performed. 
Permanent sample programs cannot be created from a LIS download. 
When a birth date is supplied by the LIS, the System  determines and stores the age, in days, in the 
patient demographics.  
4.3.3.1 Tests with Blanks (Na+ and K+ Urine) 
The LIS can explicitly request an unequal number of Na+ or K+ tests in urine. 
For each Na+ rep in the downloaded sample progra m, the System ensures there is an associated 
K+ rep to serve as a blan k in the following manner: 
 If there is the same number of K+ reps as Na + reps in the download, the System adds the 
requested number of Na+ and K+ reps to the sample program. (There is no need to add blank K+ reps since K+ reps are already requested.) 
 If there are more Na+ reps than K+ reps in the download, the System adds the appropriate 
number of “blank” K+ reps to the sample program, so that the number of Na+ and K+ reps are equal.  
The dilution factor for an Na+ rep and its associated  K+ rep is the same and is set to the dilution 
factor specified for the Na+ rep.  Processing Specifications  Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide 
 Pub. No. J32799 
24 2022-05-25  4.3.3.2 Assays that Share Slides (Bu and Bc) 
Bu and Bc tests are performed using the same slid e. Although the user can explicitly request an 
unequal number of Bu and Bc tests, the System programs and reports an equal number of Bu and Bc tests. 
If there are more Bu reps than Bc reps in th e downloaded sample program, the System adds 
enough Bc reps to make the rep counts equal. The added Bc reps are labeled "adjunct" and use the same dilution as the corresponding Bu rep. 
If there are more Bc reps than Bu reps in th e downloaded sample prog ram, the System adds 
enough Bu reps to make the rep counts equal. The added Bu reps are labeled "adjunct" and use the same dilution as the corresponding Bc rep. 
If the dilution factor for a Bu rep and matching Bc rep is not the same, the sample program is 
rejected with an audit code 2. 
4.3.3.3 Derived Tests 
If a downloaded program contains a derived test and the program already includes one or more 
assays that are components of the derived test, ad ditional replicates for the included assays are not 
programmed. 
If a downloaded program contains a derived test and a dilution factor is requested, the dilution 
factor is not applied to the test. No download message is generated. 
Note:  The screen Options and Configuration – Configure Assays allows users to specify 
whether or not a derived test result should be calculated and reported if that derived test’s components have been programmed. 
If the user requests the results for a derived test reported when all the components are requested in 
a downloaded program, the derived test is added (and considered directly selected) only if all components are directly selected to the sample program to the sample program. 
Note:  For example, if only Bc is requested in a program, Bu will be added but will not be 
considered directly selected . In this case, the derived test NBIL (which has two 
components, Bu and Bc) will not be added. 
If a downloaded program contains a derived test but not any of the derived test's components, 
when the components are added, they sh all be considered directly selected. Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Processing Specifications  
Pub. No. J32799 25 
2022-05-25 4.3.4 LIS Append 
The LIS may request to add tests to an existing program. This section outlines the behavior for 
dealing with these append programs. 
An append program being downloaded from the LIS finds a match with an existing saved program 
to modify when all of the following conditions are met:  
 The Sample ID of a saved sample program matches the ID of append program. 
 The patient first name, last name, and middle initial on the saved program are the same as 
on the append program. 
 The body fluid of the saved program is the same as on the append program. 
 The saved sample program was previously downloaded from the LIS. 
 The saved sample program has not been modified through the System’s GUI. 
An append program is treated as a regular downloaded program if no match is found. 
Not In Process : An append program is composed with  the matching saved program that is not in  
process  in the following ways to create a resultant program:  
 Any tests specified in the append program not existing in the saved program are added 
along with any related tests (deriv ed, blanks, two-result, components). 
 Any tests specified in the append program th at exist in the saved are added, overwriting 
the existing tests. Any non-existing related tests will also be added (derived, blanks, 
components). 
 Non-test program information from the append program will overwrite existing 
information. 
Note:  Assays in the saved program but not in the append program remain in the resultant 
program. 
In Process:  An append program is composed with the matching saved program that is in process  
in the following ways to create a resultant program: 
 Any tests specified in the append program not existing in the saved program are added 
along with any related tests (derived, blanks , two-results, components) provided that all 
related tests also do not exist in the saved program. 
Note:  Derived tests will not be automatically added if one of the components is already in the 
program and the second component is appended 
 Any tests specified in the append program th at exist in the saved program are ignored. 
 All other non-test program information and patient demographics from the append 
program overwrite exis ting information.  
Note:  Assays in the saved program but not in the append program remain in the resultant 
program. Processing Specifications  Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide 
 Pub. No. J32799 
26 2022-05-25  The following audits are performed  on the resultant program as well as the append program:  
 Remove Sample Indices (SI) assays for programs with mixed SI and non-SI assays. 
o If the program does not exist in the databa se, SI tests will be removed from the 
resultant program and no download message will be generated. 
o If the program exists in the database, and has not started, SI tests will be removed 
from the resultant program and no download message will be generated. 
o If the program exists in the database, and is in process: 
o If the original program was SI only, a ll Non-SI assays will be ignored and 
download message 27 will be generated. (Refer to Appendix H Download Messages.) 
o If the original program was not SI only, all SI assays will be ignored and no 
download message will be generated. 
 Program pretreated assays separately. (Dow nload message 23.  Refer to Appendix H 
Download Messages.) 
 Too many assays. (Download message 16. Refer to Appendix H Download 
Messages.)An append program with no tests indicated updates non-test program 
information and patient demographics only. 
4.4  Uploading Result Records 
The System provides a method to upload test results, patient, and physician demographics. 
The System uploads result records to the Lab Computer provided all of the following conditions 
are met: 
 The Lab Computer is able to accept transmissions. 
 No downloads are occurring at the time. (Not Applicable for HL7) 
 No host queries are in process. 
 Result records exist and are ready to be uploaded. 
 No inventory queries are in process. 
If the System is configured for the ASTM protocol, results are sent to the LIS with the Result 
Upload message. See Section 5.2.2 for the message structure. 
If the System is configured for the HL7 protocol, results are sent to the LIS with an OUL message, 
Unsolicited Specimen Container Oriented Observation, (event R23).  See Section 5.4.4 HL7 OUL 
Unsolicited Observation Message Structure. 
Note:  The OUL^R23 message event is relatively new in HL7, specifically for lab automation 
equipment container-oriented test results. Even though the message is titled Unsolicited 
Specimen Container Oriented Observation, there is very little that distinguishes a 
solicited result from an unsolicited result so there is only one result type message for 
both. See Chapter 7.3.8 of the HL7 2.5 Specification, 2003 . 
Results with multiple replicates have each rep licate uploaded along with the mean of the 
replicates.  Mean results are indicated by an MN code in the ab normal flags field. 
For results records where the mean concentration is suppressed, the numerical value and units are 
suppressed for a mean result record. 
For semi-quantitative/qualitative assays the numeri cal value and units are suppressed in a result 
record if the assay is not configured  to display value with the result. 
Results with 0 (e.g., Derived Tests) or 1 replicate record have only the test record sent. Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Processing Specifications  
Pub. No. J32799 27 
2022-05-25 For results records that have the following:  
 a qualitative categorization  
 a numerical result outside the reportable range 
the categorization takes priority and the following occurs: 
 the numerical value and units are suppressed if the system is not configured to include 
reportable range flags in the result 
 above/below reportable range flag are suppressed.  
The System uploads an extended result record  for each replicate resu lt record only when 
configured to send extended result information.  The following extended results information will 
be sent: 
 Reagents  
 Calibration 
 Quality Control (for quality control samples) 
 Diluents  
If an attempt to upload results occurs during the download of sample programs, the current sample 
program being downloaded is allowed to complete. 
Once the sample program currently being downloaded is complete, the upload of results occurs.  
The system waits for all tests in a sample to complete until results are uploaded when the upload 
mode is configured to "Sample." The system uplo ads results as each test completes when upload 
mode is configured to "Result." 
When the system is configured with an upload mode of "Group," results are uploaded using the 
following rules: 
 Measured tests are eligible for upload if they  are complete and all the other tests in the 
result record that share the same upload group are also complete. 
 Derived tests are eligible for upload if all of their components are eligible for send or 
have already been sent. 
Sample Indices tests have their own result record s like any other assay. These result records will 
be uploaded with the first result message for a sample regardless of the upload mode. 
The Sample Indices result records contain any Hemo lysis, Icterus or Turbidity codes specific to 
the sample. 
The Sample Indices results are created whet her Sample Indices is enabled or not. 
If the System is configured to include reportab le range flags in the result field, the System 
includes: 
 A ">" in front of the result value when the result is above the reportable range 
 A "<" in front of the result value when the result is below the reportable range 
QC samples always upload the numerical result and units for semi-quantitative/qualitative assays. 
Note:  This overrides the “Display value with result” selection on the "Review/Edit 
Configuration" screen in Options & Configuration. 
If configured to include qualitative text commen ts, the system uploads a result comment record 
containing the qualitative text for result records with a qualitative categorization. Processing Specifications Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide

28 2022-05-25  4.5 Host Query 
4.5.1 Basic Functionality 
The user can configure the Host Query feature to be either on or off. 
If the System is configured for the ASTM protocol, a host query is sent to the LIS with a Host 
Query message. See Section 5.2.3 Host Query/Query Cancel Message Structure for the message structure. 
If the System is configured for the HL7 protocol, a host query is sent to the LIS with a QBP_ZOS 
message, Host Query Message. See Section 5.4.5 HL7 QBP_ZOS Host Query Message Structure. 
The System requests sample program information based on the barcode of the sample. 
The System processes all downloaded sample prog rams (either requested or unsolicited) while a 
query is pending. If the System is configured for the HL7 protocol , a host query response is  received from the LIS 
with a RSP_ZOS message, Host Query Response. See Section 5.4.6 HL7 RSP_ZOS Host Query 
Response Message Structure. 
If the System is configured for the ASTM protocol , a host query response is received from the LIS 
with an Order Download message for successful  queries and a Failed Host Query Response 
message for unsuccessful queries.  See Sections  5.2.1 Order Download Message Structure and 
5.2.4 Failed Host Query Response Message Structure. 
4.5.2 Host Query Timer 
The user sets a timer that determines how long the System waits for a response to a query.  The 
default timer value is 2.4 seconds, but this can be changed to values between 1.9 and 9.9 seconds. After a configuration change, a timer change  goes into effect with the next query. 
The Host Query timer starts when the query  record/segment is sent to the LIS. 
The Host Query timer stops when any one of the following conditions occurs: 
A matching specimen ID with sa mple program is download
ed.
No samp
le program is available for the query. (For ASTM, the indication is an “I” in th e
t
ermination code field of the Message Termin ation Record. For HL7, the indication  is the
Que
ry Response Status value of “NF” that  is returned in the QAK segment of th e
RSP^ZOS
.)
An 
error has occurred. (For ASTM, the indication is a “Q” in the termination code field
of the Message Termination Record. For HL7, the indication is the Query Response
Status value of “AE” or “AR” that is re turned in the QAK segment of the RSP^ZOS.)
The 
timer has expired.
Note: An append program can satisfy a Host Query. 
If a query is requested and the timer expires before a response to the query, an attention error is posted with text substitution displaying the timer value and the sample ID. 
Once a query has been requested and a response is pending, no results are uploaded.  
If a query request is sent and the timer expires, a query cancel message is sent. For HL7 protocol, 
a QCN message is sent.  See Section 5.4.7 HL7 QCN Host Query Cancel Message Structure. For ASTM protocol, a Host Query Cancel message is sent. See Section 5.2.3 Host Query/Query Cancel Message Structure. Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Processing Specifications  
Pub. No. J32799 29 
2022-05-25 4.5.3 Sending and Receiving Messages 
Each query that is sent is a separate message. 
The priority of requests from highest to lowest shall be: 
 Canceling a query request 
 Requesting a query 
 Responding to an inventory query 
 Uploading asynchronous notifications 
 Uploading results 
The termination code field of the termination record is ignored unless it contains a Q (Error in the 
last request) or an I (no information available). For HL7 Query Response Status, a value of “AR”, 
“AE” or “NF” is returned in th e QAK segment of the RSP^ZOS.  
The specimen ID field of the Order record is ignor ed when there is an I in the termination code 
field of the Message Termination Record.  For HL7-Query Response Status, a value of “NF” is 
returned in the QAK segment of the RSP^ZOS. 
If a Q (error in the last request) or an I (no info rmation available) is in the termination code field 
of the Message Termination record, a condition code is posted.  For HL7 Query Response Status, 
a value of “AR”, “AE” or “NF” is returned in the QAK segment of the RSP^ZOS. 
If Host Query is turned off, no further queries are sent. If Host Query is turned off while a request is in process, the request will finish. 
Note:  If Host Query is turned off while there are pending queries, those queries waiting to be 
sent are purged.   
4.5.4 Host Query Priority 
If the protocol is set to ASTM and a Host Query request needs to be sent to the LIS while 
messages are being downloaded, the download of the current message is allowed to complete. 
The query is allowed to start and end (includi ng cancel) before the System initiates any other 
requests. 
If the protocol is set to ASTM, messages are being uploaded, and a query is requested; the upload 
stops on a frame boundary unless the next frame to send is the last. 
If the protocol is set to ASTM and an upload is interrupted due to a query request, the System 
sends a T (sender cancel) in the Termination Code  field of the Message Termination record.  
If the protocol is set to HL7, messages are being uploaded, and a query is requested; the upload 
stops on a message boundary. 
If the protocol is set to ASTM and the upload of results for a patient record was interrupted due to 
a host query request, all previously transmitted re sults for that patient (ASMT Patient record) are 
resent along with those results not sent once the upload resumes.  
Note:  Downloaded messages include sample programs and inventory queries. Uploaded 
messages include results, inventory replies, and asynchronous notifications. 
The messages upload when no additional queries are pending. Processing Specifications  Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide 
 Pub. No. J32799 
30 2022-05-25  4.6 Inventory Query 
The System accepts incoming inventory queries when no inventory queries are in process. 
If the System is configured for the ASTM protocol , an inventory query is received by the LIS with 
an Inventory Query message. See Section 5.2.5 Inventory Query Message Structure. 
If the System is configured for the HL7 protocol, an inventory query is received from the LIS with 
an INR Equipment Inventory Request message. See Section 5.4.8 HL7 INR Equipment Inventory Request Message Structure. 
The System sends an inventory response message when: 
 No downloads are occurring at the time  (Not Applicable to HL7) 
 No host queries are in process 
 An inventory query was recei ved from the Lab Computer 
If the System is configured for the HL7 protocol, an inventory update is sent to the LIS with an 
INU Equipment Inventory Update message. See Section 5.4.9 HL7 INU Equipment Inventory 
Update Message Structure. 
If the System is configured for the ASTM protocol, an inventory update is sent to the LIS with an 
Inventory Response message. See Section 5.2.7 Inventory Response Message Structure. 
An inventory response message contains Reagent Inventory Records if the Inventory Type code in 
the Inventory Query record is either R (Reagents) or A (All inventory types). 
An inventory response message shall contain Diluent Inventory Records if the Inventory Type 
code in the Inventory Query record is eith er D (Diluents) or A (All inventory types). 
An inventory response message contains a Bulk Consumables Inventory Record if the Inventory 
Type code in the Inventory Query record is either B (Bulk Consumables) or A (All inventory 
types). 
If the protocol is set to ASTM and an inventory query cannot be processed, the System responds 
with a message containing only a Header and Tra iler record. The Termination Code of the Trailer 
record is Q (Error In Last Request).  See Section 5.2.6 Failed Inventory Query Response Message Structure.  
If the protocol is set to HL7 and an inventory query cannot be processed, the System responds 
with an Acknowledgement with an error segment in it.  
If the protocol is set to ASTM and inventory is not on board for the requested inventory type, the 
System responds with a message containing onl y a Header and Trailer record. The Termination 
Code of the Trailer record is I (No Informatio n Available). See Section 5.2.6 Failed Inventory 
Query Response Message Structure.

4.7.4 Status Messages 
Note: This feature is only supported for the ASTM protocol. 
When the System/Subsystem change s, the System sends the information to the Lab Computer via 
asynchronous messages: 
 The System statuses communicated to th e Lab Computer are “R eady”, “Equilibrating”, 
“Initializing”, etc. The Subsystem stat uses are “Ready” or “Not Ready”. 
Note: The System status may be “Ready” while one of the Subsystems is “Not Ready” 
(for example, if the Subsystem is disabled in Options). 
 If the System is “Not Ready”, “Equilibrating” , etc., the status message contains the 
reason why (for example, Mi croSlide incubator temperature out of range, MicroSlide 
incubator humidity out of range, cuvette supply inoperative, etc.) 
 The Analyzer status is sent to the LIS with  an Instrument Status Message Notification 
message. See Section 5.2.12 Status Query Response Message Structure. 
If the Analyzer status changes, the Analyzer will send an Analyzer Status message 
asynchronously.  
The default configuration for the asynchronous Analyzer Status messages is disabled. It must be 
enabled by Ortho Care. 
4.8 Test Completion Status Messages 
Note: This feature is only supported for the ASTM protocol. 
The System responds to a query (containing the Sa mple ID) from the Lab Co mputer with the time 
to result for all the assays that are being run on the sample: 
 For all the assays that are complete, the System returns “sample completed”. 
 For all the assays for which distribution has not occurred yet, the System returns “sample 
not started”. 
 If the sample program does not exist, th e System returns “sample not found”. 
 For the assays that are in progress, the Sy stem returns the time to result expressed in 
minutes:seconds. 
 A test completion query is received by the Lab Computer with a Test Completion Status 
Query message. See Section 5.2.13 Test Co mpletion Status Query Message Structure. 
The System responds with a Te st Completion Status message.  See Section 5.2.14 Test 
Completion Status Query Message Structure.

5.  Message Specifications 
The following specifications apply to all protocols. 
In order to provide consistency with Sample Programming and to meet database storage 
requirements, the field size limits described in Section 4.3.1 Supported Fields are used.  
Not supported fields for all records are ignored on a download. 
The System uploads null values for any field listed as Not supported for all records.  
The System transmits and receives data streams using Unicode/UTF-8. 
The System transmits and receives data stream s using the ISO8859/1 Extended ASCII character 
set. 
The character encoding  is configurable. 
Note:  Only one character encoding is supported at a given time. 
The System logs an error if it receives a me ssage using a character set different from its 
configured character set. 
The System transmits unmappable characters as a tilde (~) for the ASTM protocol and a pound 
sign (#) for the HL7 protocol. 
Note:  Not all UTF-8 characters can be mapp ed to the Extended ASCII set.  
The System does not allow the “+” character to be used as an encoding character.  The “+” 
character is reserved as a separa tor for the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic universal test identifier. 
5.1 Common Record Specifications

5.3 ASTM Records 
ASTM Records are the components that make up ASTM Messages. In the tables that show the 
field sequences, shaded rows with Not Supported in the Notes column indicate fields that are not 
supported by the System. No data is sent in these field positions. The Column Headings of "D" 
and "U" indicate the optionality of the fields in the record when Downloading to the System (D) and Uploading to the LIS (U). The column Heading of “R” indicates the Repeatability. Use the table below as a key for the values in these columns: 
D U R 
R = Required Field A = Always Sent Y = Field can repeat.   
O = Optional Field S = Sometimes Sent Blank = Field Does not 
repeat 
N = Never Used N = Never Sent  
- = not applicable - = not applicable  
 
The System ignores incoming Result, Request Information, Scientific, and Manufacturer 
Information record types with the exception of Manufacturer Information records defined in this 
document. 
The software accepts and ignore s the following escape sequences: 
 &H&   Start highlighting text 
 &N&  Normal text (end highlighting) 
 &Zcccc& Local ( manufacturer) defined escape sequence  
The software accepts and supports  the following escape sequences: 
 &F&  Embedded field delimiter character Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide  Message Specifications

2022-05-25 5.5 HL7 Message Segments 
The following section defines the HL7 message segments that are used. All segments are 
terminated with a Carriage Return <CR> (hex 0D0A).  This designation cannot be changed. 
The delimiter values are given in MSH-1 and MSH-2 and used throughout the message. 
Applications must use agreed-upon delimiters to parse the message segments.  The recommended 
delimiters for laboratory messages are listed in the first two fields of the MSH segment.  The 
System employs the delimiters for all upload messa ge segments.  This is not configurable.   
Escape sequences for field separator, componen t separator, subcomponent separator, repetition 
separator, and escape character are also valid within an ST (String) data field.  No escape sequence 
may contain a nested escape sequence. 
The following escape sequence s are used in the System: 
\F\ field separator 
\S\ component separator 
\T\ subcomponent separator 
\R\ repetition separator \E\ escape character 
\Xdddd...\ hexadecimal data  
The following message segments are used for HL7 messages. In the tables that show the field 
sequences, shaded rows with Not Supported in the Notes column indicate fields that are not 
supported by the System. No data is sent in these field positions. The Column Headings of “D” and “U” indicate the optionality of the fields in the record when Downloading to the System (D) 
and Uploading to the LIS (U). The column Heading of “R” indicates the Repeatability. The 
System uses only the first repetition when it expects a single value. All other repetitions are ignored. Use the table below as a key for the values in these columns:  
D U R 
R = Required Field A = Always Sent Y = Field can repeat.   
O = Optional Field S = Sometimes Sent Blank = Field Does not 
repeat 
N = Never Used N = Never Sent 9 = Integer for max # of 
repetitions 
- = not applicable - = not applicable  
The “DT” column indicates the HL7 Datatype.

2022-05-25 Appendix A  Notes 
Delayed Response 
When an Assay Data Disk (ADD) is being loaded onto the System (about 10 minutes), the System 
cannot process any incoming reques ts from the LIS. This delayed response in the communications 
between the LIS and the System may cause the LIS to time out. Communication is reestablished automatically when the ADD load has been completed. 
Example: If the LIS sends an Inventory Query to the System during an ADD load, the query 
cannot be completed and the LIS may time out. The Inventory Query takes approximately 1 minute to process. Analyte Codes Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide

CC  Configuration 
Conflict A configurable parameter 
prevented a result from 
being fully evaluated. Check the configuration for the 
affected assay. 
Example 1:  An assay with 
qualitative reporting has one end of its reportable range set so that 
one of the qualitative categories 
could never be reached. No 
qualitative categorization is 
performed.   Example 2:  A sample program 
contains a demographic character 
that is not a valid character at the time of processing. The default 
reference range will be used 
instead of a demo

in the sample. The code is 
reported with the Bc result. No result  is reported. 
The Pl code can be 
reported with Bu. In this 
case, the code indicates 
that Bc is not readable by the System. As a result, the 
Bu cannot be reported. 
The PI code can also be reported with AcP. In this 
case, the code indicates a 
substrate depletion condition that shows the 
probable presence of 
bilirubin. If the PI code appears with the Bu 
result, dilute the sample with a 
normal patient sample or 7% 
BSA. Then repeat the test on the BuBc slide. Refer to the 
appropriate Instructions for Use

Communications 
Mechanical Interface 
An EIA RS-232 (or CCIT V.24) compatible serial  communications port with a standard DB25F 
female connector (such as AMP Inc., Part No. 2 066 53-1) is used to connect the VITROS® 5600 
System, the VITROS® XT 7600 System, the VITROS® 4600 System, the VITROS® 3600 
System, or the VITROS® XT 3400 System to the laboratory computer. The VITROS® 5600 System, the VITROS® XT 7600, the VITROS® 4600 System, the VITROS® 3600 System, and 
the VITROS® XT 3400 System use chassis-mounted connectors rather than cable-mounted 
connectors. If the laboratory computer being conn ected to the System is  EIA RS-449 (or other 
standard interface) compatible, you mu st install an interface adapter. 
Data and Transmit Cont rol Pins 
The System is configured as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE). 
Pin 1 Protective 
ground (AA). 
Pin 2 System - Transmitted data (BA) - Serial data from the System 
to the laborator y computer. 
Pin 3 System - Received data (BB) - Serial data from the laboratory 
computer to the S ystem. 
Pin 4 Request to send (CA) - Control signal from the System that 
indicates the S ystem is read y to transmit data. 
Pin 5 Clear to send (CB) - Control signal to the System that indicates 
the laborator y computer is read y to receive data. 
Pin 6 Data set ready (CC) - Control signal to the System that 
indicates the laborator y computer is on-line. 
Pin 7 Signal ground (AB) - Common ground reference point for all 
circuits except AA. 
Pin 8 Carrier Detect (CF) - Optional. 
Pin 20 Data terminal ready (CD) - Control signal from the System to 
the laborator y computer that indicates the S ystem is on-line. 
 
Cable 
The user supplies the standard interface cable . Cable configurations are determined by the 
interface to the laboratory computer. Most computer systems have an RS-232-compatible serial 
port and emulate DTE or DCE (D ata Communications Equipment). A null-modem cable is used if 
the laboratory computer is a DTE emulator. A stra ight-through cable is n eeded if the laboratory 
computer is a DCE emulator. For hardware flow control, the laboratory computer output signal is 
connected to the System’s Clear to  Send (CTS) input. On a System, a cable length of no more than 
50 feet (5.24 meters) is recommended to mainta in electrical signal characteristics defined by 
standard EIA RS-232C. Mechanical/Electrical Inte rfaces for Serial Communications Labor atory Information System (LIS) Guide

ASTM Wire Cable Configuration 
Electrical Interface 
The System operates interface signals according to the voltage levels and electrical characteristics 
defined by EIA Standard RS-232 (August 1969), which are +5 V to +25 V for a SPACE (logic 0) and –5 V to –25 V for a MARK (logic 1). The System uses the NRZ encoding technique with 
signal transitions between +12 V (logic 0) and –12 V (logic 1). 
The DSR signal is used as the on-line indicator  from the laboratory computer. If the DSR goes 
OFF during transmission, an error is reported. No further communication is attempted until the 
DSR signal is active. If DSR goes ON, the commun ication will resume with the Header Record. 
When DSR switches to OFF during communicati on, a single ATTENTION level condition is 
reported. Network Communications through Ethernet Laboratory Information System (LIS) Guide
